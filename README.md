# PWC-Virtual-internship--Power-BI
The digital revolution and our rapidly evolving world demand a transformation in skills. It's not just about acquiring digital skills; this revolution encompasses building digital awareness, emotional intelligence, and creativity to thrive in the future workplace. The time to act is now.

At PwC, we are collaborating with organizations worldwide, leveraging our client work and upskilling our 276,000 employees. However, more efforts are needed to ensure everyone can learn, work, and engage in the digital world, which is central to our mission.

We are empowering motivated employees to accelerate their skills through a “career pivot” to become “Digital Accelerators.” These accelerators rapidly enhance their expertise in digital specialties, including data, automation, AI, and digital storytelling, by mastering various self-service tools and coding languages and applying these skills across our business.

We are delighted to have you join us – welcome to the team! Giulia will be your manager and guide you through your Power BI upskilling journey, setting you on the path to becoming a true data expert and Digital Accelerator. Without delay, your reputation has already spread, and an important client has reached out, seeking your assistance in visualizing their data.
